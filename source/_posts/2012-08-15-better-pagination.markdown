Today I was experimenting with jQuery plugins and came up with [Better Pagination][bp]. 

Better Pagination is a jQuery plugin written in coffeescript that provides infinite scroll and/or loading of elements by clicking on a show more button. This is often useful when listing a lot of elements and you don’t want to do normal pagination within a table. It is kind of like what facebook does when you are scrolling down your news feed.

It’s a very small file (1.64KB min version) and fully configurable. All requests happen through AJAX.

Any doubts, concerns, sugestions or corrections you want make, [github issues page][issues] is a great place to do so.
